<h2>My Miscellany</h2>
<p>My name's Dave, and this Miscellany is supposed to be a venture into being able to share a multitude of information I've gathered. I collect autographed trading cards and similar memorabilia and wanted a place to be able to show off my collection. I've also been a historical reenactor, a soccer referee, a woodworker, a paralegal, and a firearm instructor. I've worked at an oil refinery and have published a book. I assumed that it would be worthwhile to include links on this miscellany about other things that I have found interesting over the course of my life. It also felt like a good use of static webpages - rather than attempting to use Wordpress or similiar. I'm also a big fan of the 'retro' look of a basic html static page for content that doens't need to be dynamic. I hope that something in these pages brings you joy!</p>

 <h2>Autograph Collecting</h2>
 <p>I've collected autographs since I was a pre-teen, having collected my first thru-the-mail autographs in 1991 when I collected the autographs of Cecil Fielder, Roberto Alomar, and Todd Van Poppel. I was hooked after that! I would love to have the largest collection of autographs, according to Guinness, eventually, but I've got a very long way to go.</p>
 <p>It's a fun hobby for me, especially as a through the mail experiment because I not only get the hit of dopimine when I receive an autographed card, but there's also an additional hit of dopamine that someone sent a letter back to me. As an autistic individual with ADD, PTSD from boy scout camp and having dealt with major depression for the majority of my life, I am happy to chase the dopamine!</p>
 <p>If you're interested in my autograph collection, it can be viewed <a href="autographs.html">here.</a> I'm slowly uploading images as I am able to get the material scanned.</p>
<p>14 February 2025: added 9 scanned cards across the autographs page. </p>
